# CLAUDE.md — seed / bootstrap placeholder

## Agent

This repository hosts the **data-refinery-cli** agent.

## Description

Agent and CLI for data quality in storage and retrieval — validating, deduplicating, and checking the integrity and freshness of data as it is stored and fetched. Split out of eidetic-cli so eidetic keeps agent-memory; sibling to daria, the Data Refinery Intelligent Agent.

## Re-init instruction

This file is a seed. To expand it into your full runtime prompt:

1. Open this repo in Claude Code (or your preferred AI assistant).
2. Run `/init` — the assistant will read the repo, incorporate the description
   above, and replace this seed with a complete `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Commit the result.

Until you run `/init`, `data-refinery-cli` satisfies the `steward doctor`
`prompt-file-present` and `backend-consistency` invariants (a `CLAUDE.md`
exists and `culture.yaml` declares `backend: claude`) but the prompt is not
yet tailored to this agent's domain.
